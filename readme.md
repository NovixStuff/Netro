## What are the features Netro has?

- Friend History (Allows you to see your full friend history, tracks when you become friends with someone for lost friendship with a user)
- Last Online (Tracks when your friends were last online, Requires your friend to have their "Online status" set to friends+)
- Best Friends (Allows you to mark a user as a best friend if you have them added)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Netro:

### 1. Create a `.env` file

In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`. This will be used to securely store your `.ROBLOXSECURITY` cookie.

### 2. Add your cookie

Inside the `.env` file, insert the following line:

```env
RBLX_KEY=your_.ROBLOXSECURITY_cookie_here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never share your `.ROBLOXSECURITY` cookie. Keep this file private and secure.

### 3. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Node.js modules:

```bash
npm install express dotenv node-fetch cors node-cache
```

### 4. Start the server

Use the command below to start your local Netro server:

```bash
node server.js
```
