# Netro – Local Tools for Your Online World

Netro is a passion project created by yours truly, NovixStuff.

## What is Netro?

Netro is a local server you can run on your PC or home server. It’s designed to give you a better way to explore Roblox without unnecessary browser extensions, while being able to fully customize it to suit your needs.

# How do you start the server?

Step 1 - Make a .env file in the root of the folder. This will be used to ensure your .ROBLOXSECURITY cookie stays secure/

Step 2 - Insert ```RBLX_KEY=your_.ROBLOXSECURITY_key_here``` and replace the key value with your .ROBLOXSECURITY cookie.

Step 3 - Install the required modules by running ```npm install express dotenv node-fetch cors node-cache```

Step 4 - Start the server by running ```node server.js```
